Notes: 

* The data have been normalized and bounded within [-1,1] (variables 3 through 68). 
* Units of acceleration are “g”’s, or equivalents of the acceleration due to gravity (9.80665 m/sec^2).
* Units of angular velocity are radians per second.
* As used in this code book, “magnitude” means Euclidean norm.
* Frequency domain signals were produced by applying a Fast Fourier Transform to some variables. The resulting frequency domain variables are prefixed with an ‘f’ (as opposed to the time domain variables, which are prefixed with a ‘t’).

A SPECIAL NOTE ON THE VALUE OF VARIABLES 3 - 68:

* THE SUMMARY OUTPUT DATA FRAME CONTAINS THE MEAN OF EACH OF THE VARIABLES 3 – 68 THAT ARE LISTED BELOW, BY “activity” AND “subject”. For clarity, I chose not to label the variables below as “Mean of the mean body acceleration along the x axis”, etc.

Variables:

1. activity
Factor with 6 levels: "laying", "sitting", "standing", "walking", "walking_downstairs", "walking_upstairs".  The activity that the subject was conducting while data were recorded.
